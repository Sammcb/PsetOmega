This is a game based on solving logical expressions. It presents the user with a statement about two doors. The statement could either be true or false. The program also presents the user with a randomly generated logical expression made up of two-input operators. The user must then solve the logical expression in under a minute and compare the answer to the statement about the door to determine which door is safe. The levels increase with difficulty as the user progresses. The game will end after a certain number of levels. The game was made using the QT5 framework and python 3. In order to run the program, you will need to install the pyqt5 module. On Ubuntu machines, this can be done using this command: sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.
